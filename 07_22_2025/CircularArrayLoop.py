"""

We are given a circular array nums, where each nums[i] indicates how many steps to move. Positive 
means move forward. Negative means move backward. Our task is to check if there exists a cycle of 
length > 1 such that the movement follows the values in nums circularly, the movement is entirely 
in one direction, and the cycle eventually loops back to the same index. This is a cycle detection 
problem, like the classic Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare. We must try to start from each index and attempt 
to detect a cycle. If a cycle is found from any starting point, return True. To avoid reprocessing, 
we mark elements that are already known not to be part of a cycle.
