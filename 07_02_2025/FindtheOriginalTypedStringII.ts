/**
 *
 * Alice types a string but sometimes holds keys too long, causing repeated characters in the final output.
 * Given this final typed string word and an integer k, determine how many possible original strings Alice
 * might have intended to type whose length is at least k. Each original character can be repeated one or more
 * times to produce the observed runs of repeated characters in word. Since the number of
 * possibilities can be very large, return the count modulo 10^9 + 7. The final string word can be viewed as a
 * sequence of runs of repeated characters. Each run corresponds to at least one original character,
 * but possibly more due to repetition. To find all possible original strings, we need to count how many ways
 * to partition each runâ€™s length into one or more original characters. The problem reduces to counting combinations
 * of run-length partitions across the whole string, with the constraint that the total original string length is at
 * least k. The DP counts how many ways to distribute the repeated characters across runs to get original strings of
 * various lengths. Using prefix sums for transitions makes this fast, and in the end, you sum only those ways
 * where the original length meets the minimum length k.
