"""

To ensure a password is strong, it must be the correct length, include at least one lowercase 
letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit, and avoid having three or more repeating characters 
in a row. The key to fixing a weak password efficiently is recognizing that we can insert, delete, 
or replace characters, and the best strategy depends on the password's length. If it's too short, 
we focus on insertions and missing character types; if it's within range, we prioritize replacing
repeated sequences and adding missing types; and if it's too long, we first delete excess characters
especially from repeating sequences to minimize replacementsâ€”then fix any remaining issues. 
The goal is to use the fewest operations to satisfy all conditions.
