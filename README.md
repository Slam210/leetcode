# LeetCode Practice

Welcome! This repository contains my ongoing LeetCode problem solutions as I work to get back into the habit of coding regularly.

## Approach

For each problem, a consistent three-step process:

1. **Understand the intuition behind the problem**
2. **Implement a solution in code**
3. **Analyze the runtime complexity**

## Problem Formats

### Before June 14th

- Solutions are provided **only in JavaScript**.
- Write-ups and code were stored separately.
- You can find the original write-ups here:  
  [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11gW6rl7ztRX4m__z6qBaiRCsOHiHWl89?usp=share_link)

### After June 14th

- I follow a multi-language schedule for writing solutions:

| Day       | Language   |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Sunday    | JavaScript |
| Monday    | C          |
| Tuesday   | Python     |
| Wednesday | TypeScript |
| Thursday  | Java       |
| Friday    | C++        |
| Saturday  | JavaScript |

---

### After July 7th

- I follow a new multi-language schedule for writing solutions:

| Day       | Language   |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Sunday    | SQL        |
| Monday    | C          |
| Tuesday   | Python     |
| Wednesday | TypeScript |
| Thursday  | C++        |
| Friday    | Java       |
| Saturday  | SQL        |

- I will begin shortening the amount of daily problems to 6 (1 daily and 5 regular problems) in the attempt to begin full stack developing apps and websites once more. These projects can be found throughout my github and will be listed below.
- First Project (Nextjs, React, Tailwind, Payload, MongoDB, Stripe, tRPC):  
  [Basic Ecommerce Site](http://github.com/Slam210/ecommerce)
  [Personal Portfolio](http://github.com/Slam210/slam-portfolio)

---

### After July 21st

- Easy problems will no longer have summary, intuition, and time/space complexity analysis
- Medium problems will have summary, intuition, time/space complexity analysis on the top and bottom of page
- Hard Problems will be additionally commented to help further develop understanding.

---

### Beginning Augest 4st

- Language will be strictly typescript as that is the language I am beginning job applications in
