"""

We want the count of x such that the factorial x! has exactly k trailing zeros. 
Since trailing zeros come from factors of 5, the function f(x) increases stepwise, jumping 
only at multiples of 5. This structure ensures that if a solution exists for a given k, it 
consists of a block of exactly 5 consecutive integers, otherwise, there are no solutions. 
Therefore, we only need to binary search for the smallest x where f(x) >= k. If f(x) equals k, the answer is 5, otherwise itâ€™s 0.
