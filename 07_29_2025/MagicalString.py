"""

We're given an integer n, and a magical string s that is made up of only '1's and '2's. The 
string has this self-generating property that group consecutive characters in s. We count how 
many times each character occurs in each group. These counts form the string s itself. The 
goal is to return the number of '1's in the first n characters of s. We donâ€™t need to generate 
the entire infinite magical string, just up to n characters. We build the string by maintaining 
a list of digits, starting with 1, 2, 2. A pointer i tells us how many times to repeat the next 
digit. We flip between appending 1 or 2, and repeat the flipped digit s[i] times. Stop when the 
length of the generated string reaches n.
