"""

In the Zuma Game, the objective is to clear a row of colored balls by inserting balls from our hand such that 
every group of three or more consecutive balls of the same color is removed recursively. To solve this, we use 
a Breadth-First Search approach where each state is a combination of the current board, the hand, and the number 
of steps taken. We generate new states by trying all valid insertions that might trigger removals, prune redundant 
moves using sorted hand and color-matching rules, and recursively remove balls using a helper function. The intuition 
is to explore all valid game states efficiently while minimizing insertions, and return the minimum number of moves 
required to empty the boardâ€”or -1 if impossible.
