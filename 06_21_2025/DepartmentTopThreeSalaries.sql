/*

For each employee, the query shoud count how many distinct salaries in their department
are greater than or equal to theirs. If this count is 3 or less, it means the
employeeâ€™s salary is among the top three unique salaries in that department. 
This way, the query identifies all employees who earn one of the top three 
salaries.
