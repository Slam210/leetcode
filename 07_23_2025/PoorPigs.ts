/**
 *
 * We are given buckets, which is the total number of buckets, one of which is poisonous, minutesToDie
 * which is the minutes it takes after drinking for a pig to die and minutesToTest which is the total
 * minutes we have to test. We must determine the minimum number of pigs required to figure out exactly
 * which bucket is poisonous within the allowed time.  Each pig can be used multiple times based on the
 * number of test rounds available (minutesToTest / minutesToDie). In each round, a pig either dies or
 * survives, and across all rounds, a single pig can encode multiple outcomes. This gives each pig T + 1
 * distinct states (where T is the number of rounds). With p pigs, we can distinguish (T + 1)^p combinations
 * as we can think of each pig as a digit in a base-T + 1 number system. We need to find the smallest number
 * of pigs p such that these combinations can uniquely identify all buckets.
