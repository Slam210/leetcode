 * We are given a string s and two operations. We can  remove "ab" and earn x points or remove "ba"

 * to maximize the total points by performing these operations optimally. Since both operations
 * remove overlapping character pairs, the order of removals can affect the final result. To maximize
 * the score we always prioritize removing the higher-value pair first. After removing as many of
 * the higher-value substrings as possible, remove the lower-value ones.
