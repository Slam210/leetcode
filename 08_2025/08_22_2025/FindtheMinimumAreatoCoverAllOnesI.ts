/**
 *
 * When approaching this problem, we recognize that the smallest rectangle containing all 1s must be bounded by the
 * outermost positions where 1s appear. By scanning through the grid, we can track the minimum and maximum rows and
 * columns that contain at least one 1. This ensures that we cover all possible 1s without leaving empty space outside.
 * Once the boundaries are identified, calculating the area is straightforward: it is simply the product of the
 * rectangleâ€™s width and height.
