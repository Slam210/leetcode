/**
 *
 * We're given a square grid n x n where each cell contains a number of fruits. Three children start
 * from three corners of the grid: top-left (0,0), top-right (0,n-1), and bottom-left (n-1,0). All
 * children must reach the bottom-right (n-1,n-1) using exactly n-1 moves, but each follows different
 * movement rules. If multiple children land on the same cell, fruits are only counted once. The goal
 * is to find the maximum total number of fruits collected by all children combined. The intuition is
 * to treat this as a multi-agent path optimization problem. Since the childrenâ€™s movements are constrained
 * and the number of steps is fixed, we can use dynamic programming (DP) with memoization to simulate all
 * valid moves simultaneously, ensuring shared cell handling.
