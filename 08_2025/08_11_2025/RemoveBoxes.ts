/**
 *
 * We have a row of colored boxes, each represented by a number. In each move, we can remove a contiguous
 * sequence of boxes with the same color, scoring k * k points where k is the length of that sequence. Our
 * goal is to maximize total points by planning the removal order. At first, it seems like we should just
 * remove the largest group available, but thatâ€™s often not optimal because merging same colored boxes that
 * are initially separated can yield more points later. This means our state must remember not just the start
 * and end of a subarray, but also how many same-colored boxes are "attached" to the left from earlier moves.
 * This means that we can solve this using dp.
