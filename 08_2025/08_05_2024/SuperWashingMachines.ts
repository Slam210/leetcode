/**

 * We are given an array machines[] where machines[i] is the number of dresses in the i-th washing machine.
 * In one move, any subset of machines can give 1 dress to one of its adjacent machines. The goal is to
 * make all machines have the same number of dresses using the minimum number of moves. If itâ€™s not possible,
 * return -1. To balance all machines, the total number of dresses must be divisible by the number of machines.
 * After that, we simulate passing dresses left to right, tracking the cumulative imbalance at each position.
