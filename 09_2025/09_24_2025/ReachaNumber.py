We keep adding moves until the total distance S we could have traveled is at least as large as the absolute target. 
Then, since we can flip some moves from right to left, we check whether (S - target) is even. If itâ€™s even, we can 
adjust the path to land exactly on the target, otherwise we add more moves until it becomes even. This guarantees 
the smallest number of moves.
