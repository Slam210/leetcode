/**
 *
 * We are tasked with reducing num1 to zero using operations of the form num1 - (2^i + num2).
 * To solve this, we think in terms of performing k operations. After k steps, the total
 * subtracted must equal num1. That subtraction consists of k * num2 plus a sum of k powers of two.
 * Therefore, for a solution to exist, the difference num1 - k * num2 must be non-negative, at least k,
 * and expressible using at most k powers of two. By systematically checking possible values of k, we can
 * identify the minimum number of operations or determine that itâ€™s impossible.
