We solve this by first counting how many nodes the list has, then dividing this length into k buckets as evenly as possible.
Each bucket will hold Math.floor(length / k) nodes, and if there are leftovers, we distribute them one by one to the first 
few buckets. Then, walking through the linked list, we carefully detach segments of the required lengths to form the new parts. 
By the end, weâ€™ll have exactly k parts, some possibly null if the list was too short.
