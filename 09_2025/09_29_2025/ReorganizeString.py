"""

We realize the key is to manage character frequencies so no two identical characters end up adjacent. 
By always choosing the most frequent characters next, we minimize the chance of duplicates colliding. 
We can implement this with a max-heap: repeatedly pop the two highest-frequency characters, append
them to the result, reduce their counts, and push them back if theyâ€™re not exhausted. This greedy strategy 
ensures a valid arrangement whenever possible, otherwise we return an empty string.
