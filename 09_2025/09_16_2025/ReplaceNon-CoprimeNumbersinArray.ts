/**
 *
 * We approach this problem by thinking of it as a chain-reaction merging process.
 * Whenever we encounter two adjacent numbers that are non-coprime, we merge them
 * into their LCM, but this new number may also need to merge with its previous
 * neighbor. To manage this efficiently, we use a stack. Each number is processed
 * one at a time. If it canâ€™t merge, we push it onto the stack and if it can merge,
 * we keep combining until no more merges are possible. By the end, the stack contains
 * the final modified array.
