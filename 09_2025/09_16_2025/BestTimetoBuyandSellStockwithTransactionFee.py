We solve this by treating the problem as state transitions. Each day, we decide whether to hold or not hold a stock. 
If we hold, the maximum profit is the better of staying in hold or buying today. If we donâ€™t hold, the maximum profit 
is the better of staying without stock or selling today. By updating these two states across all days, we ensure we 
account for all transactions and fees.
