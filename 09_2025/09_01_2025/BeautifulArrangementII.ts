 * We need to generate a permutation of 1..n such that the consecutive differences produce exactly k

 * we stop and simply append the leftover numbers in increasing order, which preserves the distinct difference count.
 * This approach guarantees exactly k distinct values while satisfying the problemâ€™s requirements.
