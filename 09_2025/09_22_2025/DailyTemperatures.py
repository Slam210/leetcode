"""

We scan the temperatures from left to right and maintain a stack of indices whose next warmer day hasnâ€™t been found yet. 
When we encounter a temperature higher than the one at the index on top of the stack, we pop that index and compute the 
distance between the current day and that popped index. We keep popping while the current temperature is higher than the 
temperature at the top of the stack.
