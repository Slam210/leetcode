/**

 * We want to efficiently determine whether a search word can match a dictionary word with exactly one character
 * modification. To do this, we first organize dictionary words by their lengths. Then, during a search, we skip
 * unnecessary comparisons by only checking words of the same length. For each word, we check how many characters
 * differ. If itâ€™s exactly one, we return true. Otherwise, after checking all candidates, we return false. This
 * keeps the design simple, direct, and efficient enough for the problem constraints.
