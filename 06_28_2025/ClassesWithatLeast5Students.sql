/*

Write a solution to find all the classes that have at least five students.
Return the result table in any order. The idea is to group by class and select
those having 5 or more.

*/

/* Example Table */
Create table If Not Exists Courses (student varchar(255), class varchar(255))
Truncate table Courses
insert into Courses (student, class) values ('A', 'Math')
insert into Courses (student, class) values ('B', 'English')
insert into Courses (student, class) values ('C', 'Math')
insert into Courses (student, class) values ('D', 'Biology')
insert into Courses (student, class) values ('E', 'Math')
insert into Courses (student, class) values ('F', 'Computer')
insert into Courses (student, class) values ('G', 'Math')
insert into Courses (student, class) values ('H', 'Math')
insert into Courses (student, class) values ('I', 'Math')

/* Solution */
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;
