/**
 * 
 * We have a rand7() function that returns a uniform random integer from 1 to 7.
 * We must implement rand10() that returns a uniform random integer from 1 to 10
 * using only rand7(). We cannot use any built-in random function. We want to
 * use the randomness of rand7() to simulate the randomness of rand10(). Since 7
 * < 10, we need to combine multiple calls to rand7() to expand the range. Two
 * calls to rand7() gives us a 7Ã—7 grid = 49 possible outcomes. If we map
 * numbers from 1 to 49, and just take the first 40 of them, we can map 1->40 to
 * 1-> 10 and the rest as a reject and retry.
