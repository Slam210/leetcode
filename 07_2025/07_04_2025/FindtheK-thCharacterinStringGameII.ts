/**
 *
 * The problem asks us to find the k-th character in a string built from a series of
 * transformations starting from "a". Each operation either doubles the string by appending
 * a copy of itself or appends a version where each character is shifted to its next alphabet
 * letter. Instead of building the entire string, which becomes exponentially large, we track
 * how the stringâ€™s length grows and reverse-simulate the operations to trace back where the
 * k-th character came from. By doing this in reverse, we determine whether the character
 * originated from the first or second half of a previous version, and accumulate how many
 * shifts were applied. Ultimately, the answer is the original 'a' shifted by the total number
 * of accumulated shifts, allowing us to compute the result efficiently without ever constructing
 * the full string. This is the same process as the previous problem, however, we only need to shift
 * when the operation is 1.
